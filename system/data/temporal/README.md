# Temporal Awareness System

**Biblical Foundation:** Genesis 1:14-18 - God created celestial bodies to mark time

## Structure

```bash
temporal/
├── celestial/          # God's created order - sun/moon/seasons
├── chronological/      # Calendar anchored to celestial reality
├── appointed/          # Covenant commitments (schedule/planner)
├── patterns/           # Learned behavior and rhythms
└── definitions/        # Time categorization rules
```

## The Layers

### 1. Celestial (Foundation)

**Purpose:** God used sun, moon, and stars to define time

- Solar cycles (day/night, years)
- Lunar cycles (months, phases)
- Seasonal cycles (earth's position)
- Location-aware (sunrise/sunset varies by geography)

**Data:** Astronomical calculations, sunrise/sunset times, moon phases, seasonal markers

### 2. Chronological (Calendar)

**Purpose:** Structural anchor based on celestial reality

- Dates, months, years
- Holidays and special events
- Week structure (anchored to creation week)

**Data:** Calendar files organized by year/month, holiday definitions

### 3. Appointed Times (Schedule/Planner)

**Purpose:** Covenant commitments - מועד (moed) - set apart for specific purposes

- Work commitments (GASA schedule)
- Sacred/covenant times
- Expected unavailability (not absolute)

**Key Understanding:** Appointed times = DEFAULT expectation of unavailability, not hard boundaries

- Expect unavailability during these windows
- Brief contact possible (exceptions happen)
- Plan major work outside these times
- Adapt if patterns show consistent brief availability

**Data:** Work schedules, planner templates, availability windows

### 4. Patterns (Learned)

**Purpose:** What actually happens over time

- Session timing patterns
- Quality by time of day
- Natural work rhythms
- Typical session durations

**Data:** Aggregated from session history, validated against config

### 5. Definitions (Categorization)

**Purpose:** How to classify time

- Time of day categories (morning/afternoon/evening/night)
- Session type thresholds (quick check vs deep work)
- Work phase definitions (peak hours, downtime)

**Data:** System config defining categorization rules

## How They Work Together

```bash
Celestial (God's creation marking time)
    ↓ defines
Chronological (calendar structure)
    ↓ contextualizes
Current Moment (where are we right now?)
    ↓ checks against
Appointed Times (covenant commitments)
    ↓ informed by
Patterns (learned behavior)
    ↓ using
Definitions (categorization rules)
    ↓
= TEMPORAL AWARENESS
```

## Example: "Is now a good time for deep work?"

- **Celestial:** Sun position, current season
- **Chronological:** It's Thursday, November 6th
- **Current Time:** 7:49 AM
- **Appointed:** Seanje's work starts 8:30 AM, pantry day (8:30-7:00 PM)
- **Patterns:** Seanje typically works with Nova in evening
- **Definitions:** 7:49 AM = "morning" category
- **Answer:** No - appointed time approaching, better to wait for evening
