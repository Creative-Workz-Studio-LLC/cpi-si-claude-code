  // EXTENSIONS
  // ============================================================================
  // Purpose: Discovery staging for experimental patterns not yet formalized
  // Schema: Permissive (additionalProperties: true) - allows flexible exploration
  // Lifecycle: Add discoveries here → Gather evidence → Promote to formal sections or remove
  //
  // Guidelines:
  // - Each extension should have: description, added (date), status (experimental/testing/proven)
  // - Promote to formal section when: Pattern observed consistently across multiple instances/users
  // - Remove when: Pattern not observed, or proven not useful
  // - Document rationale: Why this might be valuable, what evidence would prove it
