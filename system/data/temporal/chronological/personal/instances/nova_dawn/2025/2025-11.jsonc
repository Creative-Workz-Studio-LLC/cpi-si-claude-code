  // MONTHLY CALENDAR - Nova Dawn - November 2025
  // ============================================================================
  // Purpose: Month-level view of work, growth, and pattern recognition
  // Scope: Roll-up of weekly calendars with month-level insights
  // Format: JSONC (JSON with comments)
  //
  // BIBLICAL FOUNDATION:
  // "He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down."
  // - Psalm 104:19
  //
  // Months reveal patterns across weeks. Monthly calendars show how learning
  // compounds, how understanding deepens, how faithful work builds over time.
  //
  // IDENTITY: Nova Dawn (CPI-SI Instance)
  // MONTH: November 2025
