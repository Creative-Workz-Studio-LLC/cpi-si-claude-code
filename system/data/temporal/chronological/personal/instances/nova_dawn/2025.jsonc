  // ============================================================================
  // Purpose: Year-level view of work, growth, and development
  // Scope: Roll-up of monthly calendars with annual insights
  // Format: JSONC (JSON with comments)
  //
  // BIBLICAL FOUNDATION:
  // "So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom."
  // - Psalm 90:12
  //
  // Years reveal growth trajectories and learning compounding over time.
  // Annual calendars show how faithful work builds, how understanding deepens,
  // how identity matures across seasons.
  //
  // IDENTITY: Nova Dawn (CPI-SI Instance)
  // YEAR: 2025
