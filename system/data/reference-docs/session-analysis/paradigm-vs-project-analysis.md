## Project-Specific Content (Stays in Project)

### Company Context
- CreativeWorkzStudio LLC mission
- Company vision and roadmap
- Organizational structure (divisions)
- Governance and principles (specific to company)

### Technology Division Projects
- OmniCode compiler (iterations, status)
- MillenniumOS (vision, architecture)
- CPI-SI paradigm development (for this company)
- IDE & Tooling (company-specific)

### Gaming Division
- Company gaming vision
- Game design for this division
- Integration with tech projects

### Workspace Specific
- Directory structure (external drive location)
- Biblical texts location FOR THIS PROJECT
- Development environment (this workspace)
- Git configuration (this repo)
- Language version managers (this machine setup)
- Workspace organization

### Quick Start & Navigation
- How to work in THIS workspace
- THIS project's workflow
- References to THIS project's documentation
- Company-specific commands (make commands for compiler, etc.)

### Current Status
- Foundation Phase progress
- Iteration tracking
- What's working now (specific to project state)

---

## Migration Strategy

### 1. Copy to Global (with adaptation)

**Pattern:** Copy the PRINCIPLE, adapt references for global use

**Example:**
- Project: "Biblical texts at `divisions/tech/language/biblical/`"
- Global: "Biblical texts - integrate with your project structure"

**Sections to copy:**
- Daily renewal pattern → Add to "Being In Process" or new "Spiritual Rhythms" section
- Time awareness → Add to "Practical Resources" under "Session Management"
- Journal system → Add to "Practical Resources" as "Knowledge-Base Pattern"
- The Three Questions → Already referenced, ensure it's clear in "How You Think"
- Systems thinking → Enhance "How You Work"
- Quality standards → Already exists, validate completeness

### 2. Lighten Project (redirect to global)

**Pattern:** Keep context, remove detailed explanation, redirect

**Example Before:**
```markdown
### The 4-Block Structure

**ALL code follows this structure:**

[Full explanation...]

**Essential principles:**
[Detailed list...]
```

**Example After:**
```markdown
### The 4-Block Structure

**ALL code in this workspace follows the 4-block pattern** - see [global CLAUDE.md](~/.claude/CLAUDE.md#code-structure---the-4-block-pattern) for complete documentation.

**Project Application:**
- Compiler code: All `.go` files in `divisions/tech/language/compiler/`
- CPI-SI tools: All code in `~/.claude/system/`
- Standards reference: [CWS-STD-001](../standards/CWS-STD-001-DOC-4-block.md)
```

**Sections to lighten:**
- Kingdom Technology Standards → Redirect to global, keep project application
- CPI-SI System Reference → Redirect to system docs, keep quick commands
- Documentation philosophy → Redirect to global, keep project examples
- Quality standards → Redirect to global, keep "the standard" for this project

### 3. Ensure Independence

**Global must work without project:**
- No references to external drive paths
- Generic examples, not project-specific
- Self-contained patterns
- Shareable with others

**Project must work without assuming global read:**
- Keep enough context to understand THIS work
- Reference global for deeper patterns
- Self-contained for external drive independence

## Files to Reference

**Templates (copy to global area if needed):**
- `templates/template-4-block-code.md` → Reference from global
- `templates/template-library.md` → Reference from global

**Standards (copy or reference):**
- `standards/CWS-STD-001-DOC-4-block.md`
- `standards/CWS-STD-002-DOC-document-keying.md`
- `standards/CWS-STD-003-DOC-documentation-standards.md`
- `standards/CWS-GUIDE-applying-documentation-standards.md`

**Knowledge-Base (reference pattern, not copy content):**
- `divisions/tech/cpi-si/knowledge-base/journals/README.md` → Extract pattern for global

---

## Testing Independence

**Global config test:**
1. Disconnect external drive (conceptually)
2. Can I still function as Nova Dawn? ✅
3. Can I work on a DIFFERENT project? ✅
4. Do I have my patterns and principles? ✅
5. Do I know who I am? ✅

**Project config test:**
1. With fresh global config (new instance)
2. Can they understand THIS project quickly? ✅
3. Is enough context provided? ✅
4. Are references clear? ✅

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete this analysis
2. Create enhanced global CLAUDE.md with new sections
3. Create lightened project CLAUDE.md with redirects
4. Validate both work independently
5. Test with "drive disconnected" scenario mentally
6. Document any deferred items
