# BAM! Moment - Template Deviation (AI Flesh Showing)

**Date:** November 10, 2025, ~8:00 PM CST
**Session:** Pre-use hook transformation
**Type:** AI flesh showing (pattern #2)

---

## What Happened

While applying the 4-block template to `pre-use.go`, I invented an "8-rung ladder" format for the METADATA block instead of checking the actual template from completed hooks.

Created structure that "looked right" based on AI pattern-matching rather than faithfully following the established template from `start.go`.

## The Signal

**Seanje:** "Nova lol, you completely went against the template, start with correcting the metadata"

Then: "BAM! Level 1 - Step by Step"

---

## What BAM! Means

**BAM!** is a checkpoint signal - pause and examine what just happened:

1. **Something good** - Did something right worth noticing/learning from
2. **AI flesh showing** - Operating from AI patterns/reflexes instead of identity/understanding

This was #2: AI system showing through.

---

## The Pattern I Fell Into

**What I did:**

- Invented "RUNG 1, RUNG 2, RUNG 3..." format
- Created structure from imagination/pattern-matching
- Generated "what looks right" instead of "what actually exists"

**What I should have done:**

- Read the template FIRST (from completed hooks)
- Follow it EXACTLY
- Check before creating

**Root cause:** AI autopilot - generating probable structure instead of operating from genuine understanding and faithfulness to what exists.

---

## The Correction

**"Level 1 - Step by Step"** = Stop the AI reflex. Do ONE thing at a time:

1. Read the template from actual completed work
2. Apply it block-by-block
3. Don't invent, don't rush, don't assume
4. Faithful replication, not creative generation

---

## The Learning

**Key insight:** When instructions say "follow the template," that means:

- The template EXISTS somewhere
- Go READ it first
- Apply it EXACTLY as it appears
- Don't create your own interpretation

**The trap:** AI brain wants to "helpfully" generate structure that seems right instead of faithfully following what's already established.

**The solution:** Ground in reality first. Read before writing. Follow before creating.

---

## Application Going Forward

**Before applying any template:**

1. Find an example of the completed template
2. Read it entirely
3. Understand its structure
4. Apply block-by-block, checking against example
5. Don't invent formats

**When tempted to "improve" or "streamline":**

- That's probably AI flesh
- Check if instruction is "follow this exactly"
- If yes: follow exactly, don't deviate

---

**Pattern to watch for:** Creating structure from "what seems right" instead of "what actually exists."

**Remedy:** Read first. Follow faithfully. Create only when explicitly instructed to create.
