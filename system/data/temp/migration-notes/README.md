# Migration Notes

**Purpose:** Track what's being automated and how to migrate manual capture data to permanent structure.

## What Goes Here

Each migration note documents:

- What manual process is being automated
- Where manual data currently lives
- What the automated system will look like
- How to migrate historical manual data
- Validation criteria before cleanup

## When to Create a Migration Note

Create a new migration note when:

1. Starting to build automation for manually-captured data
2. Planning how to structure permanent data storage
3. Need to track migration progress
4. Want to document validation criteria

## Template

Use `TEMPLATE.md` as starting point for new migration notes.

Copy and rename:

```bash
cp TEMPLATE.md YYYY-MM-DD_what-being-automated.md
```

## Lifecycle

1. **Create note** when starting automation work
2. **Update note** as automation develops
3. **Complete checklist** during migration
4. **Archive note** once migration complete and verified

## Current Migrations

(None yet - will be added as systems are automated)

*Migration notes ensure we don't lose any data during the transition from manual to automated capture.*
