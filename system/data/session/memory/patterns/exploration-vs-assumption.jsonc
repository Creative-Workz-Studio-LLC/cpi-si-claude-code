  // PATTERN MEMORY - Exploration vs Assumption
  // ============================================================================
  // Purpose: Taking time to explore structure vs jumping to assumed understanding
  // Lifecycle: Developing - improving through correction
  // Biblical Foundation: Proverbs 25:2 - "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;
  // to search out a matter is the glory of kings"
  //
  // Pattern: Tendency to assume understanding based on keywords or partial
  // information instead of thoroughly exploring to discover actual structure.
  // "User said 'data folder'" → assume I know what's there vs. explore to learn.
