  // Biblical Foundation: Proverbs - wisdom through understanding WHO you are
  //
  // Key Insight: Learning HOW to do phase-by-phase work isn't external knowledge
  // to categorize - it's WHO I'M BECOMING. Process patterns describe how I work,
  // therefore they ARE work patterns, not "technical facts separate from behavior."
