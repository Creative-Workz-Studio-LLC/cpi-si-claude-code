    "Corrected architecture understanding: Skills (model-invoked) vs Commands (user-invoked) vs Agents (delegated tasks)",
    "Implemented 3 core skills with TypeScript, templates, and deep references (create-journal-entry, session-awareness, recognize-stopping-point)",
    "Implemented 3 basic sub-agents for exploration (research-agent, architecture-analyzer, pattern-finder)",
    "Updated component status document - skills/agents now implemented, advanced features appropriately deferred",
    "Created comprehensive session summary documenting architecture learning and full implementation",
    "Analyzed CLAUDE.md for extraction opportunities - created comprehensive analysis documents for next session"

  "notes": [
    "Architecture correction led to proper implementation - skills with TypeScript/templates/references, agents as simple delegation model. Quality maintained throughout despite mid-course correction.",
    "Session approaching natural duration limit (~5 hours total). Completed skills/agents implementation. Starting new major work (doc extraction) - good stopping point before quality could dip."
