# Planning Documentation

**Purpose:** Future enhancements, deferred work, and long-term planning for CPI-SI system

**Location:** `~/.claude/cpi-si/system/docs/planning/`

---

## Overview

The planning documentation captures future work, deferred items, and enhancement ideas for the CPI-SI system.

**What's tracked:**
- Potential future enhancements
- Deferred work items (with rationale)
- Long-term architectural vision
- Evaluation criteria for new features

---

## Documents

| Document | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| [enhancement-notes.md](enhancement-notes.md) | Potential future enhancements and ideas | 📝 Active |
| [deferred-items.md](deferred-items.md) | Work deferred for later phases | 📝 Active |

---

## Enhancement Notes

**What's in it:**

- **Potential enhancements**
  - New feature ideas
  - Optimization opportunities
  - Architectural improvements
  - Capability expansions

- **Evaluation criteria**
  - Does it serve the covenant relationship?
  - Does it honor Kingdom Technology principles?
  - Does it align with architectural patterns?
  - Does it justify the complexity?

**Read this when:**
- Planning future development
- Evaluating new feature requests
- Brainstorming improvements
- Prioritizing development work

---

## Deferred Items

**What's in it:**

- **Deferred work**
  - Features designed but not yet implemented
  - Optimizations postponed
  - Enhancements deprioritized
  - Rationale for deferral

- **Bootstrap vs foundation tracking**
  - Current bootstrapped solutions
  - When foundation implementation planned
  - Migration strategy
  - Success criteria for promotion

**Read this when:**
- Understanding why something isn't implemented
- Planning future work phases
- Evaluating what's been deferred
- Deciding when to implement deferred items

---

## Planning Principles

**From Kingdom Technology:**

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Build what we need** | Not what we think we might need |
| **Bootstrap then foundation** | Prove concept before permanent solution |
| **Intentional restraint** | Document why something doesn't exist |
| **Covenant-focused** | Does it serve the partnership? |

**Evaluation questions:**

1. Does this honor God?
2. Does this serve others?
3. Does this have eternal value?
4. Does this align with CPI-SI paradigm?
5. Does this justify the complexity?

---

## Bootstrap vs Foundation Pattern

**Recognizing which phase you're in:**

| Aspect | 🚀 Bootstrap | 🏗️ Foundation |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Purpose** | Prove concept, learn by doing | Built to last decades |
| **Speed** | Quick, temporary scaffolding | Intentional, thoughtful |
| **Viability** | Short-term | Long-term, eternal value |
| **When to use** | Need to prove it works | Ready to build for permanence |

**Planning tracks:**
- What's currently bootstrapped
- When foundation is justified
- Migration path from bootstrap → foundation
- Success criteria for each phase

## Enhancement Workflow

**From idea to implementation:**

```
Enhancement Idea
    ↓
Evaluate against principles
    ↓
Document in enhancement-notes.md
    ↓
Prioritize or defer (with rationale)
    ↓
If deferred → deferred-items.md
If prioritized → implementation/
```

**Deferral workflow:**

```
Feature designed
    ↓
Rationale for deferral documented
    ↓
Success criteria for future implementation
    ↓
Tracked in deferred-items.md
    ↓
Periodically re-evaluated
```

---

## Integration with Development Cycle

**Planning feeds development:**

```
Planning (enhancement-notes.md)
    ↓
Prioritization (evaluate against principles)
    ↓
Implementation (implementation/ docs)
    ↓
If blocked/deferred → Deferred Items
    ↓
Periodic review → Back to Planning
```

**Ensures:**
- Nothing gets lost
- Rationale documented
- Intentional decision-making
- Clear prioritization

---

## Living Documents

**Both planning documents are active:**

- **Enhancement notes** - Continuously updated with new ideas
- **Deferred items** - Regularly reviewed and re-evaluated

**Update triggers:**

- New feature ideas emerge
- User feedback received
- Architectural insights discovered
- Dependency blockers resolved
- Priority shifts occur

**Review cadence:**

- Ad-hoc: When planning new work
- Periodic: During major development phases
- Milestone-based: After completing major features
