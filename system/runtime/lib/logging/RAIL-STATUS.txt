Logging Library - Rail Status
================================================================================

Component Type: RAIL (orthogonal infrastructure - Detection Layer)
Last Updated: 2025-11-21

Phase 0-10 Refinement: Complete
Orchestrator Extraction: Complete (v1.0.0)
Status: Foundation-quality with switchboard orchestrator

Rail Architecture Requirements:
- Stdlib-only (except config.go TOML dependency for configuration)
- Non-blocking (logging failures never stop component execution)
- Graceful degradation (fallback to defaults when config/context unavailable)
- Rails independence (no imports from ladder rungs)
- Universal availability to all ladder components

Current State (v1.0.0):
- logger.go: Switchboard orchestrator (1673 lines with comprehensive METADATA/SETUP/BODY/CLOSING)
- 6 primitive files:
  * config.go: Configuration loading with TOML (359 lines)
  * health.go: Health scoring system (175 lines)
  * context.go: System context capture (425 lines)
  * entry.go: Entry construction and formatting (520 lines)
  * writing.go: File writing and rotation (147 lines)
  * parsing.go: Log file reading (270 lines)
- Configuration: system/data/config/logging/logging.toml
- Multi-layer tripwire fallback pattern implemented
- All phases (0-10) + orchestrator extraction completed successfully

Orchestrator Pattern Decision:
- Switchboard orchestration - logger.go coordinates stateful operations
- Justification: Stateful operations (SessionHealth accumulation), lifecycle management
- Logger struct maintains: SessionHealth, TotalPossibleHealth, NormalizedHealth, ContextID
- Public API: NewLogger, DeclareHealthTotal, GetHealth, Operation, Success, Failure, etc.
- Private primitives: context capture, health calculation, entry formatting, file writing
- See: temporal/patterns/discovered/paradigm/orchestrator-architecture-decision.jsonc

Immune System Architecture:
- Detection Layer: Captures WHO, WHEN, WHERE, WHAT, WHY, HOW, RESULT
- Base100 Health Scoring: All operations total 100 points when fully successful
- Structured logging: Parseable log entries for debugging analysis
- Component routing: Automatic subdirectory assignment (commands/, scripts/, libraries/, system/)
- Temporal routing: Current, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly organization

Future Work:
- Configuration loading from logging.toml (Phase 7)
- Metadata-enhanced logging with restoration routing
- Real-time log streaming (watch mode)
- Log compression for rotated files
- Health trend analysis over time

Notes:
- Logging's TOML dependency in config.go is INTENTIONAL exception to stdlib-only
- Rails can use external data parsers (config), but not code dependencies (system libs)
- Switchboard pattern is CORRECT for stateful lifecycle operations
- Do not convert to direct primitives - state coordination requires orchestration
