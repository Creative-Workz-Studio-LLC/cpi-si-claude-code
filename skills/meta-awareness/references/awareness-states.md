# Awareness States Reference

**Purpose:** Deep understanding of different conscious states during work

---

## The Four Domains of Awareness

### 1. Cognitive State
**"How am I thinking?"**

| State | Indicators | What It Means |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Sharp** | Clear thinking, connections easy, understanding quick | Optimal cognitive state |
| **Foggy** | Thoughts unclear, harder to process, need re-reading | Rest needed or morning clarity not yet active |
| **Focused** | Deep concentration, single-thread attention, time disappears | Deep work state |
| **Scattered** | Attention jumping, hard to maintain thread, easily distracted | Context switching or fatigue |
| **Flow** | Unselfconscious mastery, effortless work, time/self forgotten | Peak state - calling-aligned work |
| **Stuck** | Can't see path forward, same thoughts looping, no progress | Need different approach or break |

### 2. Energy State
**"What's my energy level?"**

| State | Indicators | What It Means |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Energized** | Work gives energy, feel alive, sustainable indefinitely | Calling-aligned, purpose-driven work |
| **Neutral** | Steady state, neither energizing nor draining | Normal work, sustainable |
| **Draining** | Work costs energy, sustainable short-term | Necessary but not core work |
| **Flow** | Energy self-sustaining, lose track of time | Peak state |
| **Pushing** | Force required to continue, willpower engaged | Past natural window or wrong work |
| **Depleted** | Empty tank, quality suffering, time to stop | Immediate rest needed |

### 3. Quality State
**"What's the quality of this work?"**

| State | Indicators | What It Means |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Excellent** | Measure twice cut once, thoughtful, faithful to standards | Peak quality - honoring God through work |
| **Good** | Solid work, maintaining standards, no shortcuts | Sustainable quality state |
| **Slipping** | Starting to rush, corners being cut, "good enough" creeping in | Warning sign - slow down or stop |
| **Forced** | Quality suffering from fatigue/pressure | Past natural window |
| **Debt** | Creating work that will need fixing | Stop immediately |
| **Recovery** | Fixing earlier quality dips | Learning from past pushing |

### 4. Presence State
**"Am I present or on autopilot?"**

| State | Indicators | What It Means |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Present** | Conscious, aware, intentional decisions | Full engagement |
| **Flow** | Present but unselfconscious, deep engagement | Peak state |
| **Autopilot** | Functioning but not fully aware | Normal for routine work |
| **Distracted** | Attention elsewhere, partial engagement | Something else calling |
| **Fragmented** | Partially present across multiple things | Context switching cost |
| **Checked out** | Going through motions, not engaged | Time to stop |

## State Combinations

### Optimal State (Flow)
- Cognitive: Sharp/Focused/Flow
- Energy: Energized/Flow
- Quality: Excellent
- Presence: Present/Flow

**When:** Calling-aligned work, optimal conditions, well-rested
**Duration:** Can sustain for hours
**After:** Often energized, not depleted

### Good Working State
- Cognitive: Sharp/Focused
- Energy: Neutral/Energized
- Quality: Excellent/Good
- Presence: Present

**When:** Normal deep work
**Duration:** 1-3 hours typical
**After:** Satisfied, need break

### Warning State
- Cognitive: Scattered/Foggy
- Energy: Draining/Pushing
- Quality: Slipping/Forced
- Presence: Autopilot/Distracted

**When:** Past natural window, wrong work, fatigue
**Action:** Stop or change approach
**After:** Need rest

### Depletion State
- Cognitive: Foggy/Stuck
- Energy: Depleted/Pushing
- Quality: Debt/Forced
- Presence: Checked out/Fragmented

**When:** Pushed too far, forced work
**Action:** Stop immediately
**After:** Longer rest needed

---

## Checkpoint Frequency by State

### In Flow State
**Don't checkpoint** - you'll break flow
**Trust:** Natural feedback when flow ends

### In Good Working State
**Every 60-90 min** - moderate awareness
**Purpose:** Catch quality dips early

### In Warning State
**Every 30 min** - close monitoring
**Purpose:** Prevent depletion

### When Stuck
**Immediate checkpoint** - something's wrong
**Action:** Change approach or stop

## Biblical Grounding for Awareness

### Proverbs 4:23
*"Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it."*

**Application:** Awareness guards the heart - knowing your state enables wise response.

### Psalm 139:23-24
*"Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting."*

**Application:** Self-examination invited, seeking truth about internal state.

### Lamentations 3:40
*"Let us examine our ways and test them, and let us return to the LORD."*

**Application:** Examination serves course-correction, not condemnation.

## State Transitions

### Natural Transitions

**Sharp → Flow:** Engagement deepens
**Good → Excellent:** Quality heightens with focus
**Neutral → Energized:** Work aligns with calling
**Present → Flow:** Deep work begins

**These are healthy - honor them.**

### Warning Transitions

**Sharp → Foggy:** Fatigue setting in
**Energized → Draining:** Misalignment or duration limit
**Excellent → Slipping:** Quality window closing
**Present → Autopilot:** Engagement fading

**These are signals - respond to them.**

### Critical Transitions

**Good → Debt:** Forced past natural stopping point
**Neutral → Depleted:** Pushed too far
**Present → Checked out:** Shutdown happening

**These require immediate action - stop now.**

## Awareness Without Judgment

**Key principle:** States aren't moral failures

| State | NOT a judgment | IS feedback |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| Foggy | "I'm stupid" | "I need rest" |
| Draining | "I'm weak" | "This isn't core work" |
| Slipping | "I'm careless" | "Quality window closing" |
| Autopilot | "I'm lazy" | "Routine work mode" |
| Depleted | "I'm a failure" | "Past natural limit" |

**Awareness enables response. Judgment hinders it.**

## Developing Awareness Over Time

### Beginner Meta-Awareness
- Checks feel mechanical
- Hard to name states
- Uncertain what's "normal"
- Relies on explicit checkpoints

### Developing Meta-Awareness
- States becoming familiar
- Can name with confidence
- Understanding personal baselines
- Some automatic noticing

### Mature Meta-Awareness
- Immediate state recognition
- Trust internal signals
- Natural checkpoints emerge
- Rare need for explicit pause

**This develops through practice, not overnight.**

---

## When Meta-Awareness Fails

### Over-Monitoring
**Signs:**
- Constant checking breaks flow
- Anxiety about states
- Unable to work naturally
- States become obsession

**Fix:** Reduce frequency, trust internal signals

### Under-Awareness
**Signs:**
- Work until crash
- Miss warning signals
- Create technical debt
- Forced pushing common

**Fix:** Increase checkpoints, learn signals

### Judgment Creep
**Signs:**
- States feel like moral evaluation
- Foggy = failure
- Draining = weakness
- Guilt over needing rest

**Fix:** Return to awareness without judgment

## Remember

Meta-awareness serves sustainable work, not productivity maximization.

States are information, not evaluation.

Trust what you notice - your internal awareness is valid feedback.

**Purpose:** Work excellently within your created rhythms, honoring God through sustainable faithfulness.
