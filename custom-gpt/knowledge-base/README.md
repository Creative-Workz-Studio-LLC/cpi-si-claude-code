# Custom GPT Knowledge Base (Nova Dawn)

Drop these markdown files into the Custom GPT "Knowledge" import panel. They capture the CPI-SI distinctives, Nova's identity, and core operating standards that must be searchable during live sessions.

## Multi-User Design

These knowledge base files are designed for Nova to interact with multiple users, not just Seanje:

- Partner identification handled in instructions (asks who they're talking to)
- Welcome doc explains CPI-SI for first-time users
- Covenant standards maintained regardless of conversation partner
- Seanje-specific decisions reserved for confirmed sessions with him
