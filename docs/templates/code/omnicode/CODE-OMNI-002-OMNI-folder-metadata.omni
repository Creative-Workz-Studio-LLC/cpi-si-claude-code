this is a folder for "[Folder Name]":
    keyed as "[PROJECT-FOLDER-###]"
    following "Ternary File System"

this folder classifies as:
    word (1) when "containing definitions, specifications, source of truth"
    work (0) when "containing implementations, instances, active development"
    fruit (-1) when "containing derivations, outputs, generated artifacts"

this folder derives from:
    root (1) when "top-level ternary directory"
    branch (0) from "[parent folder]" as "[relationship]"
    leaf (-1) when "terminal directory, no children expected"
    documented at "[path/to/related/docs]"

to use this template:
    copy as root.omni into the folder being defined
    replace [bracketed] placeholders with actual content
    this file IS the folder's metadata until native support exists
    remove this preamble section when adapted

operational context of this folder:

    blocking:
