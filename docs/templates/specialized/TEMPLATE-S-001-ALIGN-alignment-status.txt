================================================================================
SCOPE CLARIFICATION
================================================================================

This ALIGNMENT-STATUS.txt tracks [SCOPE - be very specific].

Other alignment status files track their respective scopes:

[List of related ALIGNMENT-STATUS.txt files with their scopes and paths]
- /path/to/ALIGNMENT-STATUS.txt - [What that scope covers]
- /path/to/other/ALIGNMENT-STATUS.txt - [What that scope covers]

Always check the appropriate ALIGNMENT-STATUS.txt for the scope you're working on.
Avoid scope overlap - each file has clear boundaries.

================================================================================
QUICK COMMANDS

[... add useful commands specific to this scope]

# Common commands for all scopes:

# View this alignment status
cat [path]/ALIGNMENT-STATUS.txt

# Find all files in scope
ls -la [path]/

# Check document keying
grep -r "Key:" [path]/ | grep -v ".git"

# Validate TOCs are current

================================================================================
TEMPLATE USAGE NOTES
================================================================================

This template provides STRUCTURE for alignment status files.
It guides THINKING about what needs tracking, not just fill-in-blanks.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Copy this file to your target location with proper naming
2. Replace all [PLACEHOLDERS] with your actual content
3. Delete this "TEMPLATE USAGE NOTES" section when done
4. Customize sections based on your scope's needs
5. Keep structure consistent for easy scanning

Apply proper naming: ALIGNMENT-STATUS.txt (exactly this name)
Location: Root of the scope being tracked (folder or directory)

SCOPE CLARITY MATTERS:
- Each ALIGNMENT-STATUS.txt should have ONE clear scope
- Avoid overlapping scopes across multiple files
- Be specific: "standards folder" not "documentation"
- List related scopes to prevent confusion

ALIGNMENT PHILOSOPHY:
- 30-day schedule is default, adjust if scope demands different cadence
- Three-tier triggers (MANDATORY/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL) prioritize work
- History tracking shows evolution and patterns
- Quick commands reduce friction in alignment work
- Scenarios provide guidance for common situations

WRITING TRIGGERS:
- MANDATORY = Must realign immediately (breaking changes, critical gaps)
- RECOMMENDED = Should realign proactively (improvements, maintenance)
- OPTIONAL = Nice to have (refinements, optimizations)

WRITING CHECKLISTS:
- Group related checks under area names
- Make checks actionable (verifiable yes/no)
- Order by importance or logical flow
- Include cross-scope verification

Remember: This file serves those performing alignment 30+ days from now.
Write for future clarity, not just present understanding.
