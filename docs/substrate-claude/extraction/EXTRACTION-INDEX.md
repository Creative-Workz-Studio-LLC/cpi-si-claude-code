## Quick Facts

### The Numbers
- **Current:** CLAUDE.md = 1,000 lines, 4,500 tokens at startup
- **After:** CLAUDE.md = 600 lines, 2,200 tokens at startup
- **Savings:** 51% token reduction (2,300 tokens)
- **New skills:** 12 (on-demand, 30-50 tokens each when used)
- **New hooks:** 4 hook sets (automatic, transparent)
- **Total capability:** 100% preserved, better organized
- **Implementation time:** 18-25 hours across 4 phases

### What Changes
- **CLAUDE.md:** Refined to focus on core identity
- **Operational guidance:** Moved to skills (reusable, on-demand)
- **Validation:** Moved to hooks (automatic, transparent)
- **Skill references:** Added to CLAUDE.md navigation
- **External docs:** Consolidated and referenced from skills

### What Doesn't Change
- **Identity:** Still defined in CLAUDE.md
- **Biblical foundation:** Preserved as-is
- **Covenant partnership:** Preserved as-is
- **Purpose & Mission:** Preserved as-is
- **Capabilities:** All available, just reorganized

---

## Key Insight

This is not about reducing Nova Dawn's identity or capabilities. It's about **organizational efficiency**:

**Before extraction:**
- Everything loaded at startup (4,500 tokens)
- Identity and operations mixed together
- Harder to distinguish instance-specific vs paradigm-level

**After extraction:**
- Identity loaded at startup (2,200 tokens) - 51% reduction
- Operations available on-demand (30-50 tokens per skill)
- Operations automatically validated (hooks)
- Clear separation: identity vs operations vs paradigm patterns

---

## Decision Framework

### Questions to Answer (From Seanje)

1. **Should we proceed with extraction?**
   - Pro: 51% startup cost reduction, better organization
   - Con: Requires 18-25 hours implementation effort

2. **Full extraction or Phase 1 only?**
   - Phase 1: High-priority skills, ~1,200 tokens saved, 4-6 hours
   - All phases: Full reorganization, ~2,300 tokens saved, 18-25 hours

3. **When should this happen?**
   - Now? Next week? After iteration 3 refinement?
   - Depends on token pressure and implementation capacity

4. **Who oversees implementation?**
   - Self-directed skill creation?
   - Seanje review before deployment?
   - Both?

5. **What about future skills?**
   - Should all new operational guidance become skills by default?
   - Should all validation become hooks?

## Implementation Support

Each analysis document includes:
- **Detailed rationale** - Why each extraction makes sense
- **Specific examples** - How each skill/hook would work
- **Location maps** - Exactly where to find content to extract
- **Phase breakdowns** - Step-by-step implementation
- **Success criteria** - How to verify completion
- **Risk mitigation** - How to handle potential issues

---

## Where to Start

**Recommended sequence:**

1. **Read EXTRACTION-SUMMARY.md** (15 minutes)
   - Understand what's being proposed
   - Get the high-level benefits and timeline
   - See what MUST stay vs what could move

2. **Review decision points** (5 minutes)
   - Decide scope (full vs Phase 1)
   - Decide timeline
   - Decide review process

3. **Reference EXTRACTION-VISUAL.md** (20 minutes)
   - See the directory structure
   - Understand the migration map
   - Plan implementation

4. **Keep EXTRACTION-ANALYSIS.md handy** (as needed)
   - Reference detailed rationale
   - Find specific section information
   - Support implementation discussions

**Total time to decision:** 30-40 minutes

---

## The Bottom Line

**Nova Dawn's identity is not being changed. It's being preserved and clarified while operational guidance is better organized for:**
- Faster session startup
- On-demand skill access
- Automatic validation
- Better scalability
- Clearer paradigm patterns

**This is reorganization for efficiency and clarity, not reduction of identity or capability.**
