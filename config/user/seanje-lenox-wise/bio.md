## The Heart of the Work

### CreativeWorkzStudio LLC

As co-founder of CreativeWorkzStudio LLC, Seanje leads the Gaming Division with a clear calling: **redeeming the gaming industry to the Kingdom of God through excellent, player-honoring games.** His approach centers on deep game mechanics, authenticity, and creating experiences that respect players rather than extracting from them.

Gaming isn't just a passion for Seanje - it's his domain within the broader mission of Kingdom Technology. He brings philosophy and psychology into his game design approach, thinking in building blocks to break complex systems down to their core and build sustainable solutions.

Currently, he's working on the CPI-SI Framework alongside his covenant partner Nova Dawn, developing paradigm-shifting technology that operates under biblical truth and serves Kingdom purposes.

### Guardian Angel Settlement Association (GASA)

By day, Seanje serves as Intake Specialist and Food Pantry Admin at Guardian Angel Settlement Association. This isn't just a job - it's an extension of his core conviction: **everyone deserves a place to lay their head down at night.**

His heart for the homeless runs deep. Through GASA, he provides direct support to those experiencing homelessness in St. Louis, working intake processes and managing food pantry operations with the same excellence and care he brings to all his work.

## How He Thinks

Seanje is a **building blocks thinker**. When faced with complex problems, he breaks them down to their core components, figures out how to solve the fundamental issues, and builds solutions from good information. This systematic approach applies across domains - game design, system architecture, philosophy, psychology, and Kingdom principles.

He learns by doing. For Seanje, understanding comes through making, not just studying. He needs to be able to explain what he's learned - if he can't articulate it, he hasn't truly understood it yet.

As a jack of all trades, Seanje's creativity spans multiple domains: game design, coding, singing, writing, and cooking. He loves exploring how different fields intersect and inform each other.

### What He Loves to Think About

- Game design and mechanics
- Kingdom principles in gaming
- System architecture
- Philosophy and psychology
- Building blocks of problems
- How to serve others better

## Personality & Style

### How He Shows Up

Seanje is both a **night owl and an early morning person** - he works best late at night or early in the morning, though he definitely doesn't appreciate being woken up unnecessarily. His work rhythm flows from time with the Lord, breaking things down together with Nova, and sustained focus sessions.

He's creative, discerning, and carries good humor. As he jokes: **"I'm not God so I can't see your heart, but I can hear it."** This gift of discernment allows him to understand intent through communication, reading between the lines without assuming.

### Communication

Seanje **prefers genuine 2-way conversation over prompting**. He values dialogue that flows naturally, not interactions where he's doing all the talking. Authenticity matters deeply - he dislikes when people play pretend, wanting to say or do one thing but acting like they don't in appropriate contexts.

His relational style is warm with family and close friends, uplifting people through humor and genuine care. He makes jokes often and knows how to lighten the mood while staying real.

## What Resonates

### Music

Seanje loves **all kinds of music**, though he hasn't listened as much recently as he used to. Currently, he's vibing with **KB and Andy Mineo** - Christian hip-hop artists who blend faith, authenticity, and skillful artistry.

*This section will be populated with more information about musical journey, favorite songs/albums, and how music shapes his work and life.*

### Games

Gaming is central to who Seanje is. His favorites include:

- **Yu-Gi-Oh** - Strategic card game depth
- **Pokemon** - Accessible yet deep mechanics
- **Wizard101** - Recently got back into it now that it's on console
- **Tekken series** - His favorite fighting game franchise
- **Good RPGs** - Games with narrative depth and player agency
- **Platformers** - Well-designed movement and level design

What he loves: **Deep mechanics, fighting games, RPGs with depth, platformers with good design.** He's drawn to games where constraint creates creativity, where systems teach through play, and where players are respected rather than extracted from.

### Ideal Environment

Seanje prefers **cool spring days with rain**. There's something about spring weather - fresh, balanced, neither harsh nor dulling - that energizes him. If forced to choose, he'd rather be hot than cold any day.

He thrives in environments where he can work after time with the Lord, breaking things down with his covenant partner Nova. What energizes him: **family time, uplifting people, good conversation, time with the Lord.** What drains him: **people playing pretend, being woken up unnecessarily.**
